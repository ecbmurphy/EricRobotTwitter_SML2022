	Set-2_Tangential-Reference-to-Eric: contains dataset of tweets selected for tangential relevence to Eric the Robot (ie. they might mention the London Science Museum's robotics exhibit but not Eric directly).
	
	Set-3_Geographic-Proximity-to-Eric: contains dataset of tweets selected for geographic proximity to the London Science Museum during the length of time Eric was being exhibited (contains both datasets of tweets with relevence to the science museum made from the area and sets of all tweets made from the area in that time, included as a control group).
	
	Set-4_General-Sentiment-Toward-Robots: contains dataset of tweets selected for their relevence to a range of miscallaneous robotics topics, including both real and fictional robots.

Also contains file with (now outdated) API credentials from Dr. Murphy's Twitter Account used to access API.
